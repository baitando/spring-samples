# Spring HATEOAS

This sample shows how to use Spring HATEOAS to provide self-describing APIs.

After starting the application you can send requests e.g. via curl or the provided Intellij request file
in [src/main/calls](src/main/calls).

A sample curl request is

```shell script
curl http://localhost:8080/payments/234
```
